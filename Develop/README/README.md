## Description
The Professional README Generator is a Node.js application designed to streamline the creation of README.md files for your projects. By leveraging user input through the command line, this tool automatically generates a well-structured README file, ensuring consistency and saving valuable development time. The application prompts the user for essential information about their project, such as title, description, installation instructions, usage details, tests, GitHub username, email address, and license. Based on the provided input, it creates a comprehensive README file that includes a project description, installation steps, usage information, test instructions, contact details, and licensing information.
